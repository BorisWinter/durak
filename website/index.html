                This project aims to analyze a simplified version of the Russian
                card game дурак, using epistemic logic and Kripke models.

                  <h3>Introduction to Durak's rules</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                  We play Durak in this simulation with very simplified rules.
                  You can find a "playthrough" demonstration of the simple rules
                  of the game below. We play with 3 suits, and cards are ranked
                  according to number and trump suit. If Clubs is the trump
                  suit, the ranking is as follows: C4 > C3 > C2 > S4 = H4 > S3 =
                  H3 > S2 = H2.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="content">

                /></span>
                <h3>Start of the Game</h3>
                <p>
                  All players have their cards dealt to them. In our basic game,
                  the handlimit is two, meaning that every player has 2 cards.
                  Players can only see their own cards. One of the cards in the
                  deck is visible to the players (in this illustration, that's
                  the 3 of Clubs), and its suit indicates the trump suit. The
                  other cards in the deck are unknown to the players. The
                  discard pile is empty.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="content">
                <span class="image right"
                  ><img src="images/game-states/state2.jpg" alt=""
                /></span>
                <h3>First attack</h3>
                <p>
                  The first player is selected randomly, in this case, it's
                  North. This player does not have any information about the
                  player they are attacking (South), so they follow the
                  appropriate strategy.
                </p>
              </div>

                /></span>
                <h3>Successful Defence</h3>
                <p>
                  Player South can successfully defend against the attack by
                  North by playing a card with a higher value. A player has to
                  defend if they can.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3>After a successful defence</h3>
                <p>
                  Both cards go to the discard pile and "disappear" from the
                  game.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3>Hand limit</h3>
                <p>
                  As both player's hand size is lower than the hand limit of 2,
                  they both draw a new card from the deck.
                </p>

                <h3>Next attack</h3>
                <p>
                  Player South now attacks player West (not according to the
                  strategy, as West plays the highest value in the game. This
                  behaviour would not happen in our simulated games, but would
                  happen in real-life games. In this case this was done to
                  illustrate an unsuccessful defence in the next step.).
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3>Player West tries to defend</h3>
                <p>
                  Player West sees that they cannot win against Player South's
                  card.
                </p>

                <h3>Unsuccessful defence</h3>
                <p>
                  Player West is unsuccessful and takes both cards in the attack
                  field in their hand, as they could not defend.
                </p>

                /></span>
                <h3>Player South Hand Limit</h3>
                <p>
                  Player South has too few cards in hand now, and draws the
                  final card from the deck. After this, players cannot draw any
                  card from the deck anymore, and cards can only be removed to
                  the discard pile. The player that reaches zero cards in hand
                  first, wins!

              <p>
                Card games use many types of epistemic knowledge. You have the
                private and direct knowledge, about your own hand, inferred
                knowledge about the hands of the other players and the deck, and
                knowledge about the cards that have been discarded. In this
                page, we'll discuss the specific types of knowledge you can find
                in our game of Durak, our updating Kripke model, as well as
                possible extensions.
              </p>

              <hr class="major" />

              <h2>The Kripke Model</h2>
              <p>
                We model the game as a Kripke model, where every world in the
                model consists of the hands of each player + deck. So we have
                propositional atoms that consist of SUIT_NUMBER_PLAYER,
                representing that a certain card is in the hand of a player -
                and no card can be in the hand of more than one player.
              </p>

              <div class="content">
                <h3>Model properties</h3>
                <p>
                  Relations between our worlds are indistinguishability
                  relations. Given the features of Durak, our model must have
                  the following properties, as illustrated by the simplest
                  Kripke Model (right).
                </p>
                <span class="image right"

                  <dd>
                    <p>No player candistinguish a world from itself.</p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Symmetric</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      Player A can't distinguish world 1 from world 2, as A only
                      has access to its own hand. In world 2, A should still
                      consider world 1 possible. Hence, symmetric relations
                      between worlds.
                    </p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Transitive</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      If player A cannot distinguish world 1 from world 2, and
                      not world 2 from world 3, then they can't distinguish 1
                      from 3 either.
                    </p>
                  </dd>
                </dl>
              </div>

              <p>
                These properties imply that our model is an S5 model. Hence, we
                can use S5 inference rules in our model.
              </p>

              <div class="content">
                <h2>First Order Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                  First Order Knowledge is the first level of knowledge that we
                  can find in our Durak game. Every player knows the content of
                  their own hand. Additionally, players can have first order
                  knowledge about specific cards in the hands of other players.
                  For example, if there are two players left in the game, each
                  player can use the knowledge about their hand, and the cards
                  in the discard pile, to deduce the cards in the hand of the
                  other player.
                </p>

                <p>To add, how we derive knowledge from our Kripke model.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <h2>Common Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                  In Durak, there is a lot of common knowledge. When players
                  attack, the attacking card becomes common knowledge, and the
                  result of the attack (card to discard pile, or card to
                  defending player) also becomes common knowledge. Hence, once a
                  card has been played on the table once, every player always
                  knows its location from that moment on.

                <h2>Second Order Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                  There is a bit of second order knowledge in our game, but
                  since the hands of the players are so small, there is not much
                  use from it. In second order knowledge, a player knows that
                  another player knows that the first player has some specific
                  card. EXTEND

                  Not sure if this is public announcement or something
                  different. Maybe it's just a run. In any case, the state of
                  the game changes every turn, as cards switch hands.

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                  Playing with a greater hand limit, more use for higher-order
                  knowledge in the strategies
                </p>

                <p>
                  Probabilistic inference on possible cards. The player now does
                  not consider possible cards, only the cards that it knows for
                  sure. Extending this with either heuristic or formal
                  probabilistic epistemic method and taking these into accounts
                  in strategies might improve the win-chances of an agent.
